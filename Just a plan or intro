It is a personal capstone project to comprehend and implement the Hull-White Model.

Plan:
  - One PDF will contain the formulas and the solutions.
  - Several VBA/Python/R files for the codes. They will realize the Monte-Carto method.
  - Some data sets or sources to implement the codes.

Keep updating.
